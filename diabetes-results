Classification Report

Accuracy means Classification Accuracy rate of the model, in this case the Logistic Regression model has an accuracy of 79%.
Precision means how accurate your model is, in this case, the model predicts that 76% of the time a suspected patient will get diabetes.
Recall means  If there are patients who have diabetes in the test set and your Logistic Regression model can identify it 54% of the time
